## Clarity Engine 5 - Payee Intelligence Platform

### Overview
Clarity Engine 5 is an AI-powered web application designed for finance and accounting professionals. Its core purpose is to transform unstructured payee data into organized, actionable insights by intelligently classifying payees (Individual, Business, Government) and assigning SIC codes with confidence scores. The platform integrates with the Mastercard Merchant Match Tool (MMT) API for comprehensive business enrichment. It aims to be a sophisticated, enterprise-ready tool for financial data transformation and analysis, emphasizing accuracy, scalability, and robust error handling.

### User Preferences
- **Communication style**: Simple, everyday language
- **Architecture preference**: Each processing stage should be a well-contained, self-contained app for modularity
  - Classification module (standalone)
  - Finexio matching module (standalone)
  - Google Address validation module (standalone)
  - Mastercard enrichment module (standalone)
  - Akkio predictions module (standalone)
  - This allows easy bolt-on additions of new components

#### Database
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Connection**: @neondatabase/serverless with connection pooling
- **Schema**: Includes tables for users, upload batches, payee classifications, SIC codes, classification rules, and cached suppliers.
- **Cache**: Complete Finexio database of 483,227 suppliers for matching.
- **Matching Strategy V3**: Streamlined DB→Rules→AI pipeline for matching:
  1. Exact match.
  2. Trigram similarity search (top 10 candidates).
  3. Early-accept rules (exact normalized, high similarity + state match).
  4. OpenAI adjudication for ambiguous cases.
  This approach is designed for speed and accuracy.

#### AI/ML Classification Service

- **SIC Code Assignment**: Automatic industry classification.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Advanced normalization and intelligent duplicate flagging.
- **Processing Order**: Google Address validation → Finexio matching → Mastercard → Akkio.
- **Intelligent Address Enhancement**: OpenAI-powered selective address enhancement.
- **Akkio Payment Prediction**: Integrated for payment method and outcome prediction.
- **Keyword Exclusion System**: 593 permanent exclusion keywords for government/financial entities.
- **Sophisticated Fuzzy Matching**: Utilizes a 6-algorithm system (Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler, Token Set, Metaphone, N-gram, AI enhancement) for typo tolerance and variation handling using original business names.
- **Exact Match Enhancements**: Smart variations handling (LLC/INC, commas, DBA names, business suffixes) to maximize exact match rate.
