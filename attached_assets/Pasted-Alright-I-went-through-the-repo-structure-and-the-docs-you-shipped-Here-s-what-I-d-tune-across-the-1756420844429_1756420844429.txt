Alright, I went through the repo structure and the docs you shipped. Here’s what I’d tune across the **rest of the app** to make it faster, steadier, and more accurate without getting cute or novel.

---

## Fast wins you can ship now

### 1) Orchestrator: saturate, don’t swamp

Your pipeline orchestrator coordinates classification, Finexio matching, address validation, and Mastercard enrichment. It already supports parallel stages and sub-batches. Keep that, but align limits so you **fully use cores and the DB pool without queueing storms**. ([GitHub][1])

* **One throttle per stage** with `p-limit`:

  * Classification API: 12–20 in flight.
  * Finexio DB: set to `min(pool_size * 2, 40)`.
  * Google Maps: 10–15, respect QPS.
  * Mastercard (async/webhooks): 8–12.
* **Chunk size**: 200–300 rows per sub-batch. Write results after each chunk, clear arrays, let GC do its job. Your pipeline supports sub-batches already, keep it tight so RSS doesn’t drift. ([GitHub][1])
* **Backpressure**: never `Promise.all` thousands of tasks. Always wrap with the stage-specific limiter.

```ts
import pLimit from 'p-limit';
const llmLimit = pLimit(Number(process.env.CLASSIFY_LIMIT || 16));
const dbLimit  = pLimit(Number(process.env.FINEXIO_LIMIT || 32));
const mapLimit = pLimit(Number(process.env.ADDRESS_LIMIT || 12));
```

### 2) DB access (Drizzle/Postgres): stop over-fetching

Backend stack uses Node + Drizzle + Postgres + Bull/Redis. Keep it. Tighten calls. ([GitHub][1])

* **Select only needed columns**. No `SELECT *` in hot paths.
* **Prepared statements** for hot queries. Reuse them.
* **Batch writes**: `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` with 200–500 rows per statement.
* **Pool sizes**: app=20–30, worker=10–20. Separate read vs write pools if you split traffic later.
* **Statement timeouts**: fail fast, don’t stall the event loop.

  ```sql
  ALTER DATABASE yourdb SET statement_timeout = '8s';
  ALTER DATABASE yourdb SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '10s';
  ```

### 3) Queue hygiene (Bull)

You’re already on Bull and Redis. Good. Keep jobs small and idempotent. ([GitHub][1])

* Per-queue **concurrency** = CPU cores \* 2 as a start.
* **Job timeouts**: 30–60s for network stages, 10–15s for pure DB stages.
* **Retries**: 3–5 with exponential backoff + jitter.
* **Circuit breaker**: if a stage hits >30% timeouts over 1 minute, pause that queue for 60s and skip to next stage so the batch completes.

### 4) Classification: faster calls, stricter output

The README says GPT-4o for classification with JSON output. Lock that down for speed and consistency. ([GitHub][1])

* Use **JSON mode / response\_format** and a minimal schema. Keep `max_tokens` low. Temp 0.
* **One client** (undici keep-alive) shared across calls. 10–20 in flight.
* **Short prompt**. Strip examples in production. You only need schema + rules.
* **Timeout** at 12–15s and retry 3x on 429/5xx.

```ts
import OpenAI from 'openai';
const oa = new OpenAI({ timeout: 15000, maxRetries: 4 }); // reuse this instance
```

### 5) Address validation (Google)

Parallel with classification/matching as your pipeline claims. Keep memory flat and avoid repeat work. ([GitHub][1])

* **Request de-dup**: in-flight map keyed by normalized address to collapse duplicates.
* **LRU cache** 10k entries for 24h. Avoid calling Maps for identical strings.
* **Input normalization** before hitting the API (trim, collapse spaces, standardize suffixes).

### 6) Mastercard enrichment (async/webhooks)

You’ve documented a batchy, asynchronous Mastercard Track integration. Treat it like a separate pipeline with its own queue and backoff. ([GitHub][1])

* Submit in **100–200 record** chunks.
* **Webhook handler**: idempotent upserts keyed by Mastercard batch id and record id.
* **Slow-lane** queue for records that 429/5xx repeatedly. Keep the main batch flowing.

## Reliability that pays for itself

### 7) Observability: no guesswork

Give yourself a scoreboard. You’re already tracking progress and status in the orchestrator; add metrics. ([GitHub][1])

* **Prom metrics** via `prom-client`: counters, histograms, gauges.

  * `pipeline_batch_seconds{stage=...}` p50/p95/p99
  * `finexio_query_seconds` and `finexio_candidates_found`
  * `classification_seconds` and error counts
  * `address_seconds`, `mastercard_submit_seconds`
* **Structured logs** with pino. One line JSON, include `batch_id`, `row_id`, `stage`, and timings.
* **Red flags**: alert if

  * classification timeout rate >10% over 5 min
  * finexio candidate size = 0 spikes
  * heap >70% of max for >2 min (memory leak/pressure)

### 8) Memory: stream everything

Your docs emphasize stream processing and sub-batches. Keep it strict. ([GitHub][1])

* CSV/Excel: **row stream** with `highWaterMark` tuned. Never materialize whole files.
* After each sub-batch: **flush writes**, clear arrays, `global.gc?.()` if enabled.
* Replace unbounded `Map`s with **LRU+TTL** (10k–20k entries). This alone prevents slow RSS creep during long runs.

## Accuracy upgrades that are boring and effective

### 9) Deterministic first, AI as judge only when needed

You’ve already got multi-stage classification and AI-enhanced matching in the README. Keep accuracy high by stacking simple, cheap checks first. ([GitHub][1])

* **Normalize once** per row. Reuse that string everywhere.
* If **exact normalized** equals a supplier, accept. If **trigram similarity** is ≥0.96 and state matches, accept.
* **Location boost**: +0.03–0.06 to candidates that match state/ZIP. It breaks ties without ML.
* For mid-confidence cases (say 0.80–0.93), send the **payee + top 3–5 candidates** to GPT for a conservative yes/no. One call per row, JSON out. Keep temp 0 and require strict JSON.

### 10) Consistency checks

Cheap integrity rules catch silent accuracy bugs.

* If classification says **Individual**, but the matched supplier is obviously a business (keywords, suffixes), drop confidence or re-adjudicate.
* Ensure **city/state** combos agree. If distance between geocoded points is >50 miles for what should be the same entity, fail or lower confidence.

## Frontend (React/Vite) so it feels snappy too

Your frontend stack is React 18 + Vite + TanStack Query + shadcn/ui. Leverage it. ([GitHub][1])

* **SSE or WebSocket** progress stream per batch so the UI doesn’t poll every second.
* **Virtualize** large result tables and lazy-load detail panes.
* Use **TanStack Query** cache times that reflect batch cadence. Don’t refetch on every focus.
* Show **per-stage ETA** using server metrics, not guesswork.

## A few copy-paste configs

**Drizzle / Postgres pool**

```ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres';
import { Pool } from 'pg';

export const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  max: Number(process.env.PG_POOL_MAX || 20),
  idleTimeoutMillis: 10_000,
  statement_timeout: 8_000,
  query_timeout: 10_000
});
export const db = drizzle(pool);
```

**Batch upsert (200–500 rows)**

```ts
await db.execute(sql`
  INSERT INTO payee_results (batch_id, row_id, status, data)
  SELECT * FROM UNNEST(${values})  -- pg array of tuples
  ON CONFLICT (batch_id, row_id)
  DO UPDATE SET status = EXCLUDED.status, data = EXCLUDED.data
`);
```

**Stream CSV with backpressure**

```ts
import { createReadStream } from 'fs';
import { parse } from 'csv-parse';

const rs = createReadStream(filePath, { highWaterMark: 1 << 20 }); // 1MB
const parser = rs.pipe(parse({ columns: true }));
let chunk: any[] = [];
for await (const row of parser) {
  chunk.push(row);
  if (chunk.length === 250) { await processChunk(chunk); chunk.length = 0; }
}
if (chunk.length) { await processChunk(chunk); }
```

**Strict JSON call for classification**

```ts
const resp = await oa.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  temperature: 0,
  response_format: { type: "json_object" },
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "Return strict JSON only: {payeeType, sic, confidence}" },
    { role: "user", content: JSON.stringify({ name: normName }) }
  ]
});
const json = JSON.parse(resp.choices[0].message?.content ?? "{}");
```

## Where these changes plug in (from your docs)

* **Modules** called out in the repo: `Classification Module`, `Finexio Matching Module`, `Pipeline Orchestrator`, `Mastercard Service`. That’s exactly where the knobs above belong. ([GitHub][1])
* **Backend/Frontend stacks** and **data-pipeline stages** (upload, streaming, parallel enrichment, async Mastercard) match the recommendations here, so you don’t need structural rewrites to adopt them. ([GitHub][1])

## If you want a punch-list for your Replit LLM

1. Add stage-specific `p-limit` caps and sub-batch size 250 across the orchestrator. ([GitHub][1])
2. Convert hot queries to projections + prepared statements; batch upserts to 200–500 rows.
3. Enforce JSON mode and short prompts for classification; set 15s timeout + 4 retries. ([GitHub][1])
4. Add LRU+TTL for any Map caches in long-running workers.
5. Add Prometheus metrics and pino logging with batch/row/stage tags.
6. Switch UI progress to SSE and virtualize big tables.

Do these and you’ll see lower p95s, stable memory, and cleaner match/validation accuracy without changing your architecture or bringing in exotic tech.
